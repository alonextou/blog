Shipit is a deploy tool written in node.js and based on Grunt. Shipit was built to be a Capistrano alternative for people who want to write tasks in JavaScript and don't have a piece of ruby in their beautiful codebase.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```sh
npm install grunt-shipit --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-shipit');
```

## Usage

```
grunt shipit:<stage> <tasks ...>
```

## Dependencies

### Local

- git 1.7.8+
- rsync 3+
- OpenSSH 5+

### Remote

- GNU coreutils 5+

## Shipit task

### Run task

```
grunt shipit:<stage> <tasks ...>
```

### Options

#### workspace

Type: `String`

Define the local working path of the project deployed.

#### deployTo

Type: `String`

Define the remote path where the project will be deployed. A directory `releases` is automatically created. A symlink `current` is linked to the current release.

#### repositoryUrl

Type: `String`

Git URL of the project repository.

#### branch

Type: `String`

Tag, branch or commit to deploy.

#### ignores

Type: `Array<String>`

An array of paths that match ignored files. These paths are used in the rsync command.

#### keepReleases

Type: `String`

Number of release to keep on the remote server.

#### servers

Type: `String` or `Array<String>`

Servers on which the project will be deployed. Pattern must be `user@myserver.com` if user is not specified (`myserver.com`) the default user will be "deploy".

#### key

Type: `String`

Path to SSH key

### Usage example

```js
shipit: {
  options: {
    workspace: '/tmp/github-monitor',
    deployTo: '/tmp/deploy_to',
    repositoryUrl: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git',
    ignores: ['.git', 'node_modules'],
    keepReleases: 2,
    key: '/path/to/key'
  },
  staging: {
    servers: 'user@myserver.com'
  }
}
```

To deploy on staging, you must use the following command :

```
grunt shipit:staging deploy
```

You can rollback to the previous releases with the command :

```
grunt shipit:staging rollback
```

### Events

Shipit has several events describe in the workflow, you can add custom event and listen to events.

```js
grunt.registerTask('build', function () {
  // ...
  grunt.shipit.emit('buit');
});

grunt.shipit.on('fetched', function () {
  grunt.task.run(['build']);
});

```

### Methods

#### shipit.local(command, [options], callback)

Run a command locally and streams the result.

```js
shipit.local('ls -lah', { cwd: '/tmp/deploy/workspace' }, function (err, stdout) {
  // ...
});
```

#### shipit.remote(command, [options], callback)

Run a command remotely and streams the result.

If you want to run a `sudo` command, the ssh connection will use the TTY mode automatically.

```js
shipit.remote('ls -lah', function (err, stdout) {
  // ...
});
```

#### shipit.remoteCopy(src, dest, callback)

Make a remote copy from a local path to a dest path.

```js
shipit.remoteCopy('/tmp/workspace', '/opt/web/myapp', function (err) {
  // ...
});
```

### Variables

Shipit attach several variables during the deploy and the rollback process :

#### shipit.config.*

All options describe in the config sections are avalaible in the `shipit.config` object.

#### shipit.repository

Attached during `deploy:fetch` task.

You can manipulate the repository using git command, the API is describe in [gift](https://github.com/sentientwaffle/gift).

#### shipit.releaseDirname

Attached during `deploy:update` and `rollback:init` task.

The current release dirname of the project, the format used is "yyyymmddHHMMss" (grunt.template.date format).

#### shipit.releasesPath

Attached during `deploy:update` and `rollback:init` task.

The remote releases path.

#### shipit.releasePath

Attached during `deploy:update` and `rollback:init` task.

The complete release path : `path.join(shipit.releasesPath, shipit.releaseDirname)`.

#### shipit.currentPath

Attached during `deploy:publish` and `rollback:init` task.

The current symlink path : `path.join(shipit.config.deployTo, 'current')`.
