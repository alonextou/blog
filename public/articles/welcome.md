<a href="http://harpjs.com/" target="_blank">Harp</a> turned out to be an excellent choice for rapid development. I highly recommend Harp for developers looking to quickly manage content with flat files. With a built-in server and preprocessing, and my usual slew of packages and libraries, my site was functional in just hours and deploys in less than a minute.
